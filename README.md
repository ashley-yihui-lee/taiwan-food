# Taiwan‚Äôs Food Security Under a Potential Chinese Blockade

This scrollytelling project explores Taiwan‚Äôs food security in the face of a potential Chinese blockade. It combines official data, multimedia elements, and visual storytelling to examine the island‚Äôs reliance on food imports and its preparedness for crisis scenarios.

### üõ† Lessons Learned
- Talk to the expert before making the visualizations or writing the article. I initially built charts and designed the page based on Taiwan‚Äôs food self-sufficiency rate, thinking it was the key indicator. But after speaking with an expert, I realized that ‚Äúpotential‚Äù food self-sufficiency was the more relevant metric in a blockade scenario‚Äîso I had to scrap and rebuild almost everything. (Special thanks to Professor Chen Chi-chung for pointing me in the right direction!)

- Choose the most powerful way to visualize a number or trend. I scraped data from the Ministry of Defense to calculate how many PLA jets flew around Taiwan last year (about 5,000 btw) but later realized a single visualization about the Joint Sword 2024B blockade drill would tell the story more effectively. So I gave up the yearlong data (RIP to that night's work‚Äî great scraping practice though!).
